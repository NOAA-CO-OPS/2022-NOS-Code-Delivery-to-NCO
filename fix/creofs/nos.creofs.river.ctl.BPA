PARAMETER DEFINITION:

NIJ       :  Number of model grids to specify river discharges
NRIVERS   :  Number of USGS river observing stations
DELT      :  Time interval in hours for output time series.
RiverID   :  Serial Identification number of USGS River
STATION_ID:  River Identification number
NWS_ID    :  NWS Identification number for USGS river
AGENCY    :  Station owner agency name 
GRID_NODE :  Serial Identification number for model grid location to specify river input 
FLAG      :  River runoff trace flag, 0: all tracers (T & S) are off; 1: only T is on; 2: only S is on; 3: both
             T and S are on.
RiverID_Q :  RiverID in Section 1 which is used to specify river discharge at the corresponding model grid
RiverID_T :  RiverID in Section 1 which is used to specify river temperature at the corresponding model grid
Q_Scale   :  scaling factor of river discharge at the model grid
T_scale   :  scaling factor of river temperature at corresponding model grid.
Q_min     :  minimum discharge value of the river
Q_mean    :  average discharge value of the river
Q_max     :  maximum discharge value of the river
T_min     :  minimum discharge value of the temperature
T_mean    :  average discharge value of the temperature
T_max     :  maximum discharge value of the temperature
Q_Flag    :  0: use climatological river discharges data (daily mean); 1:use real-time river discharge observations.
          :  2: use stage height, have to modify soruce code to use the provided formula to ocnvert stage height into discharge
             >=3 discharge at the river is not used, river is for T and Salinity
TS_Flag   :  0: use climatological temperature data (daily mean); 1:use real-time river temperature observations.
River_Bain_Name:  Name of Rivers or river basins
