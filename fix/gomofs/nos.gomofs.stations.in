!  GLOSSARY:
!  =========
!
!  This input file provides the positions of stations data to be extracted
!  and written into STATIONS output file.  This file is use to monitor model
!  fields at frequent time intervals.  It is also used to sample the model at
!  observation locations in order to build the penalty function used in
!  variational data assimilation.
!

! Control Switch.
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
! Lstations      Switch to control the writing of station data within nested
!                  and/or multiple connected grids. Ngrid values are expected.
!                  By default this switch is set to TRUE in "mod_scalars" for
!                  all grids when the CPP option STATIONS is activated.  The
!                  USER can control which grid to process by turning on/off
!                  this switch.
!

! Station positions KEYWORDS.
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
!  NSTATION      Number of stations to process in each nested grid. Ngrids
!                  values are expected.  These values are essential because
!                  the station arrays are dynamically allocated using these
!                  values.
!
!  POS           Station locations for all grids in any desired order.  The
!                  horizontal location for a particular station can be
!                  specified in terms of fractional (I,J) grid pairs (FLAG=0)
!                  or (longitude,latitude) grid pairs (FLAG=1). Here, FLAG is
!                  a special switch and may be used for multiple purposes.
!                  The GRID column indicates nested grid number to process.
!                  This value must be one in non-nested applications.  The
!                  COMMENT section is ignored during reading and may be used
!                  to help documentation.  This locations are used to
!                  interpolate model data before writting to output STATIONS
!                  file.  The stations locations are read using the following
!                  statement:
!
!                  is(1:Ngrids)=0
!                  DO WHILE (.true.)
!                    read (unit,*,ERR=10) igrid, flag, Xpos, Ypos
